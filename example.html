It is the second largest engineering campus after the Pulchok Campus in Nepal in terms of students' priority and academics.The Pashchimanchal campus became operational from 1987 with assistance from the World Bank and UNDP/ILO. Initially technician courses were offered at the campus along with diploma courses. However, Tribhuvan University Institute of Engineering has phased out the diploma stream and henceforth stopped enrollment in this stream after 2069 BS. Now it offers engineering courses in six disciplines at bachelor level and three disciplines at masters level.
